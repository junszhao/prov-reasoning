prov-reasoning
==============
This is the source code for inferring the additional PROV triples by using different reasoning capabilities in order to test improvements on PRROV queries.

Some of the sample PROV-O data are from ProvBench 2013 (https://sites.google.com/site/provbench/provbench-at-bigprov-13).

This work is at early stage development.
